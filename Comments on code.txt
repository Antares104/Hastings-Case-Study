The other 9 models were coded in a very similar fashion so I chose to emit it from my final code file although results
can be seen in the Table 1 of my report.

Code was written to create Tables 1,2,3 in the report but were emitted from the file.

There was also code to search that new dataset of metrics to find the top preforming models.

If there are any questions about the code let me know and I can do my best to answer them.
